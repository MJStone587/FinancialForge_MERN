# FinancialForge_MERN
Financial Forge app with full MERN stack

I recreated my Financial Forge app, this time using React as my frontend. So this is my first official MERN full-stack app. I took this opportunity to improve
upon the performance and styling. Having a better understand of everything that is going on I found better opportunities to use asynchronous functions to improve
the app performance.

-also simplified this from the original so it took less time overall.
